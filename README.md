# UFOs

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using javascript and html that lists UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, shape, and duration with comments. These ufo sightings can be filtered on the webpage for easier analysis.

**Results**

**Usability:**

People can use this webpage in a variety of ways. They can see ufo sightings by a combination of different factors. They can see if there is n over concentration of sightings on specific dates. They can see whether certain cities have more sightings. They can aso look broader by state or country. They also have the ability to look up sightings by shape of the ufo. Because the search criteria can all be done at the same time, people can really hone in on the criteria they want to search for. Like New York City ufo sightings over a certain time frame or sightings in certain states by the shape of the ufo. All the search criteria is typed in on the left in an organized format.

The webpage then automatically changes once the change happens, so you get instant results.


**Summary**

**Drawback:**

One drawback is that because we have city, state and country filters that are not dependent on each other, you can put in constraints that don't exist which yields no results.

**Recommendations**

First, I would reccomend that we put in some sort of autocomplete function. If you type in something incorrect then you could potentially be getting incorrect results based on what you wanted to search for. Second, I would reccomend that we tier country, state and city so that we don't return nothing when you accidentally type in contradicting inputs.
